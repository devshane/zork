		    Welcome to Dungeon!

   Dungeon is a game of adventure, danger, and low cunning.  In it
you will explore some of the most amazing territory ever seen by mortal
man.  Hardened adventurers have run screaming from the terrors contained
within.

   In Dungeon, the intrepid explorer delves into the forgotten secrets
of a lost labyrinth deep in the bowels of the earth, searching for
vast treasures long hidden from prying eyes, treasures guarded by
fearsome monsters and diabolical traps!

   No DECsystem should be without one!

   Dungeon was created at the Programming Technology Division of the MIT
Laboratory for Computer Science by Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, Bruce
Daniels, and Dave Lebling.  It was inspired by the Adventure game of
Crowther and Woods, and the Dungeons and Dragons game of Gygax
and Arneson.  The original version was written in MDL (alias MUDDLE).
The current version was translated from MDL into FORTRAN IV by
a somewhat paranoid DEC engineer who prefers to remain anonymous,
and was later translated to C.

   On-line information may be obtained with the commands HELP and INFO.
You are facing the north side of a white house.  There is no door here,
and all the windows are barred.
You are in a dimly lit forest, with large trees all around.  One
particularly large tree with some low branches stands here.
You hear in the distance the chirping of a song bird.
You are about ten feet above the ground nestled among some large
branches.  The nearest branch above you is beyond your reach.
On the branch is a small birds nest.
The birds nest contains:
  A jewel-encrusted egg.
Taken.
There is no obvious way to open the egg.
Forest
You hear in the distance the chirping of a song bird.
North of House
You are behind the white house.  In one corner of the house
there is a window which is slightly ajar.
With great effort, you open the window far enough to allow passage.
You are in the kitchen of the white house.  A table seems to have
been used recently for the preparation of food.  A passage leads to
the west, and a dark staircase can be seen leading upward.  To the
east is a small window which is open.
On the table is an elongated brown sack, smelling of hot peppers.
A clear glass bottle is here.
The glass bottle contains:
  A quantity of water.
>Taken.
Opening the brown sack reveals:
  A clove of garlic.
  A lunch.

You are in the living room.  There is a door to the east.  To the west
is a wooden door with strange gothic lettering, which appears to be
nailed shut.
In the center of the room is a large oriental rug.
There is a trophy case here.
On hooks above the mantlepiece hangs an elvish sword of great antiquity.
A battery-powered brass lantern is on the trophy case.
There is an issue of US NEWS & DUNGEON REPORT dated 11-MAR-91 here.

		 US NEWS & DUNGEON REPORT
11-MAR-91					Late Dungeon Edition

		--- LATE NEWS FLASH!! ---
The endgame is here!  (Somewhere)
There have been some puzzling new discoveries near the Thief's hideaway.

		--- BACKGROUND INFORMATION ---

This version of Dungeon for the PDP-11/VAX-11 has been completely
reimplemented in FORTRAN-IV from the original MDL sources created
at MIT.  The parser in this version is somewhat simpler than the
parser in the ARPAnet version;  within this limit, this version
is fully congruent with the current version on the ARPAnet.

This version has been converted from FORTRAN-IV to C via f77.  If
you have any problems, please report them to:
    ian@airs.com or uunet!airs!ian (Ian Lance Taylor)

>With a great effort, the rug is moved to one side of the room.
With the rug moved, the dusty cover of a closed trap door appears.
The door reluctantly opens to reveal a rickety staircase descending
into darkness.
Taken.
The lamp is now on.
You are in a dark and damp cellar with a narrow passageway leading
east, and a crawlway to the south.  To the west is the bottom of a
steep metal ramp which is unclimbable.
The door crashes shut, and you hear someone barring it.
You are on the west edge of a chasm, the bottom of which cannot be
seen.  The east side is sheer rock, providing no exits.  A narrow
passage goes west.  The path you are on continues to the north and south.
You are in an art gallery.  Most of the paintings which were here
have been stolen by vandals with exceptional taste.  The vandals
left through the north, south, or west exits.
Fortunately, there is still one chance for you to be a vandal, for on
the far wall is a work of unparalleled beauty.
Taken.
You are in what appears to have been an artist's studio.  The walls
and floors are splattered with paints of 69 different colors.
Strangely enough, nothing of value is hanging here.  At the north and
northwest of the room are open doors (also covered with paint).  An
extremely dark and narrow chimney leads up from a fireplace.  Although
you might be able to get up the chimney, it seems unlikely that you
could get back down.
Kitchen

The lamp is now on.
Cellar
The door crashes shut, and you hear someone barring it.
West of Chasm
Gallery
>You are in the large entrance hall of the Bank of Zork, the largest
banking institution of the Great Underground Empire.  A partial
account of its history is in "The Lives of the Twelve Flatheads" with
the chapter on J. Pierpont Flathead.  A more detailed history (albeit
less objective) may be found in Flathead's outrageous autobiography
"I'm Rich and You Aren't - So There!".
Most of the furniture has been ravaged by passing scavengers.  All
that remains are two signs at the northwest and northeast corners of
the room, which say

	<-- WEST VIEWING ROOM		EAST VIEWING ROOM -->
You are in a small square room, which was used by a bank officer
whose job it was to retrieve safety deposit boxes for the customer.
On the north side of the room is a sign which reads "Viewing Room".
On the east side of the room, above an open door, is a sign reading

		    BANK PERSONNEL ONLY
You are in a large rectangular room.  The east and west walls here
were used for storing safety deposit boxes.  As might be expected,
all have been carefully removed by evil persons.  To the east, west,
and south of the room are large doorways.  The northern "wall"
of the room is a shimmering curtain of light.  In the center of the
room is a large stone cube, about 10 feet on a side.  Engraved on
the side of the cube is some lettering.
This room was the office of the Chairman of the Bank of Zork.
Like the other rooms here, it has been extensively vandalized.
The lone exit is to the north.
A portrait of J. Pierpont Flathead hangs on the wall.
Taken.

You are in a room used by holders of safety deposit boxes to view
their contents.  On the north side of the room is a sign which says

   REMAIN HERE WHILE THE BANK OFFICER RETRIEVES YOUR DEPOSIT BOX
    WHEN YOU ARE FINISHED, LEAVE THE BOX, AND EXIT TO THE SOUTH
     AN ADVANCED PROTECTIVE DEVICE PREVENTS ALL CUSTOMERS FROM
      REMOVING ANY SAFETY DEPOSIT BOX FROM THIS VIEWING AREA!

You are in a small room with passages off in all directions.
Bloodstains and deep scratches (perhaps made by an axe) mar the walls.
A nasty-looking troll, brandishing a bloody axe, blocks all passages
out of the room.
You sword has begun to glow very brightly.
You charge, but the troll jumps nimbly aside.
The axe sweeps past you as you jump aside.
>The troll's weapon is knocked to the floor, leaving him unarmed.
The troll, now worried about this encounter, recovers his
bloody axe.
>It's curtains for the troll as your sword removes his head.
Almost as soon as the troll breathes his last, a cloud of
sinister black smoke envelops him, and when the fog lifts, the
carcass has disappeared.
Your sword is no longer glowing.
>Dropped.
You are in a narrow east-west passageway.  There is a narrow staircase
leading down at the north end of the room.
You are in a deep ravine at a crossing with an east-west crawlway.
Some stone steps are at the south of the ravine and a steep staircase
descends.
You are in a crawlway with a three foot high ceiling.  Your footing
is very unsure here due to the assortment of rocks undefoot.  Passages
can be seen in the east, west, and northwest corners of the crawlway.
You are at the periphery of a large dome, which forms the ceiling
of another room below.  Protecting you from a precipitous drop is a
wooden railing which circles the dome.
The rope drops over the side and comes within ten feet of the floor.
You are in a large room with a prominent doorway leading to a down
staircase.  To the west is a narrow twisting tunnel.  Above you is a
large dome painted with scenes depicting elvish hacking rites.  Up
around the edge of the dome (20 feet up) is a wooden railing.  In the
center of the room there is a white marble pedestal.
A large piece of rope descends from the railing above, ending some
five feet above your head.
Sitting on the pedestal is a flaming torch, made of ivory.
The lamp is now off.
Taken.
You are in a north-south crawlway;  a passage also goes to the east.
There is a hole above, but it provides no opportunities for climbing.
Troll Room
You can see:  A sword.
East-West Passage
Deep Ravine
You are in a long room on the south shore of a large reservoir.
There is a western exit, a passageway south, and a steep pathway
climbing up along the edge of a cliff.
You are on the south edge of a deep canyon.  Passages lead off
to the east, south, and northwest.  You can hear the sound of
flowing water below.
You are standing on the top of flood control dam #3, which was
quite a tourist attraction in times far distant.  There are paths
to the north, south, east, and down.
The sluice gates on the dam are closed.  Behind the dam, there can
be seen a wide lake.  A small stream is formed by the runoff from
the lake.
There is a control panel here.  There is a large metal bolt on the
panel.  Above the bolt is a small green plastic bubble.
This room appears to have been the waiting room for groups touring
the dam.  There are exits here to the north and east marked
"PRIVATE", though the doors are open, and an exit to the south.
A guidebook entitled "FLOOD CONTROL DAM #3" is on the
reception desk.
There is a matchbook whose cover says "VISIT BEAUTIFUL FCD #3" here.

	You too can make BIG MONEY in the exciting field of
		      PAPER SHUFFLING!

Mr. TAA of Muddle, Mass. says:  "Before I took this course I used
to be a lowly bit twiddler.  Now with what I learned at MIT Tech
I feel really important and can obfuscate and confuse with the best."

Mr. MARC had this to say:  "Ten short days ago all I could look
forward to was a dead-end job as a engineer.  Now I have a promising
future and make really big Zorkmids."

MIT Tech can't promise these fantastic results to everyone, but when
you earn your MDL degree from MIT Tech your future will be brighter.

		   Guide Book To
		Flood Control Dam #3

  Flood control dam #3 (FCD #3) was constructed in year 783 of the
Great Underground Empire to harness the destructive power of the
Frigid River.  This work was supported by a grant of 37 million
zorkmids from the central bureaucracy and your own omnipotent local
tyrant Lord Dimwit Flathead the Excessive.  This impressive structure
is composed of 3.7 cubic feet of concrete, is 256 feet tall at the
center, and 193 feet wide at the top.  The reservoir created behind
the dam has a volume of 37 billion cubic feet, an area of 12 million
square feet, and a shore line of 36 thousand feet.

  The construction of FCD #3 took 112 days from ground breaking to
the dedication.  It required a work force of 384 slaves, 34 slave
drivers, 12 engineers, 2 turtle doves, and a partridge in a pear
tree.  The work was managed by a command team composed of 234
bureaucrats, 2347 secretaries (at least two of whom could type),
12,256 paper shufflers, 52,469 rubber stampers, 245,193 red tape
processors, and nearly one million dead trees.

  We will now point out some of the more interesting features of
FCD #3 as we conduct you on a guided tour of the facilities.

  1)	You start your tour here in the dam lobby.
	You will notice on your right that ...........
You are in what appears to have been the maintenance room for flood
control dam #3, judging by the assortment of tool chests around the
room.  Apparently, this room has been ransacked recently, for most of
the valuable equipment is gone.  On the wall in front of you is a
panel of buttons, which are labelled in EBCDIC.  However, they are of
different colors:  blue, yellow, brown, and red.  The doors to this
room are in the west and south ends.
There is an object which looks like a tube of toothpaste here.
There is a wrench here.
There is a screwdriver here.

Deep Canyon
Reservoir South
You are on what used to be a large reservoir, but which is now a
large mud pile.  There are 'shores' to the north and south.
Lying half buried in the mud is an old trunk, bulging with jewels.
Taken.
You are in a large cavernous room, to the south of which was formerly
a reservoir.  However, with the water level lowered, there is merely
a wide stream running through the center of the room.
There is a tunnel leaving the room to the north.
There is a small pump here.
Taken.
You are in an ancient room, long buried by the reservoir.  There are
exits to the southeast and upward.
On the shore lies Neptune's own crystal trident.
Your load is too heavy.  You will have to leave something behind.
>You are in a small cave with an entrance to the north and a stairway
leading down.
You are in a large square room with tall ceilings.  There are exits
on the north, east, and west sides of the room.  On the south wall is
an enormous mirror which fills the entire wall.
There is a rumble from deep within the earth, and the room shakes.
You are in a narrow crawlway.  The crawlway leads from north to south,
However, the south passage divides to the south and southwest.
You are standing in a small circular room with a pedestal.  A set of
stairs leads up, and passages leave the the east and west.
There is an extremely valuable (perhaps original) grail here.
You are in the west end of a large temple.  On the south wall is an
ancient inscription, probably a prayer in a long-forgotten language.
The north wall is solid granite.  The entrance at the west end of the
room is through huge marble pillars.
Lying in the corner of the room is a small brass bell.
This is a large room, whose north wall is solid granite.  A number
of discarded bags, which crumble at your touch, are scattered about
on the floor.  There is an exit down and what appears to be a newly
created passage to the east.
There is a silver chalice, intricately engraved, here.

Dost thou know the magnitude of thy sin before the gods?
Yea, verily, thou shalt be ground between two stones.
Shall the angry gods cast thy body into the whirlpool?
Surely, thy eye shall be put out with a sharp stick!
Even unto the ends of the earth shalt thou wander and
unto the land of the dead shalt thou be sent at last.
Surely thou shalt repent of thy cunning.

You are in a tiny cave with entrances west and north, and a dark,
forbidding staircase leading down.
You are outside a large gateway, on which is inscribed:

	"Abandon every hope, all ye who enter here."

The gate is open.  Through it you can see a desolation, with a pile of
mangled corpses in one corner.  Thousands of voices, lamenting some
hideous fate, can be heard.
The way through the gate is barred by evil spirits, who jeer at your
attempts to pass.
>One of the matches starts to burn.
The candles are lit.
The match has gone out.
There is a clap of thunder, and a voice echoes through the
cavern:  "Begone, fiends!"  The spirits, sensing the presense
of a greater power, flee through the walls.

Grail Room
Narrow Crawlway
Mirror Room
There is a rumble from deep within the earth, and the room shakes.
You are in a cold and damp corridor where a long east-west passageway
intersects with a northward path.
You are in a small chamber, which appears to have been part of a
coal mine.  On the south wall of the chamber the letters "GRANITE
WALL" are etched in the rock.  To the east is a long passage, and
there is a steep metal slide twisting downward.  From the appearance
of the slide, an attempt to climb up it would be impossible.  To the
north is a small opening.
You are standing at the entrance of what might have been a coal
mine.  To the northeast and the northwest are entrances to the mine,
and there is another exit on the south end of the room.
You are in a small room.  Strange squeaky sounds may be hear coming
from the passage at the west end.  You may also escape to the south.
You are in a small room that has only one door, to the east.
In the corner of the room on the ceiling is a large vampire bat who
is obviously deranged and holding his nose.
There is an exquisite jade figurine here.
Dropped.

Squeaky Room
Mine Entrance
You are in a large room, in the middle of which is a small shaft
descending through the floor into darkness below.  To the west and
the north are exits from this room.  Constructed over the top of the
shaft is a metal framework to which a heavy iron chain is attached.
At the end of the chain is a basket.
You are in a narrow tunnel with large wooden beams running across
the ceiling and around the walls.  A path from the south splits into
paths running west and northeast.
You are in a small non-descript room.  However, from the direction
of a small descending staircase a foul odor can be detected.  To the
east is a narrow path.

Your compass needle spins wildly, and you cannot get your bearings.
Unfortunately, it is impossible to tell directions in here.
Deep Canyon
Round Room
Unfortunately, it is impossible to tell directions in here.
You have entered a cave with passages leading north and southeast.
There are old engravings on the walls here.
>The engravings were incised in the living rock of the cave wall by
an unknown hand.  They depict, in symbolic form, the beliefs of the
ancient peoples of Zork.  Skillfully interwoven with the bas reliefs
are excerpts illustrating the major tenets expounded by the sacred
texts of the religion of that time.  Unfortunately, a later age seems
to have considered them blasphemous and just as skillfully excised them.
This is a room which is bare on all sides.  There is an exit down.
To the east is a great door made of stone.  Above the door, the
following words are written:  "No man shall enter this room without
solving this riddle--
	What is tall as a house,
	Round as a cup,
	And all the king's horses can't draw it up?".
There is a clap of thunder and the east door opens.
This is a former broom closet.  The exits are to the east and west.
There is a pearl necklace here with hundreds of large pearls.
Taken.
You are in a damp circular room, whose walls are made of brick and
mortar.  The roof of this room is not visible, but there appear to be

oblong table, no doubt set for afternoon tea.  It is clear from the
objects on the table that the users were indeed mad.  In the eastern
corner of this room is a small hole no more than four inches high.
There are passageways leading away to the west and the northwest.

Suddenly, the room appears to have become very large.
You are in a large room, one half of which is depressed.  There is a
large leak in the ceiling through which brown colored goop is
falling.  The only exit from this room is to the west.
A stoppered glass flask with skull-and-crossbones markings is here.
The flask is filled with some clear liquid.
The leak has submerged the depressed area in a pool of sewage.

You are in an enormous room, in the center of which are four wooden
posts delineating a rectangular area, above which is what appears to
be a wooden roof.  In fact, all objects in this room appear to be
abnormally large.  To the east is a passageway.  There is a large
chasm on the west and the northwest.

You are in a large room full of assorted heavy machinery.  The room
smells of burned resistors.  The room is noisy from the whirring
sounds of the machines.  Along one wall of the room are three buttons
which are, respectively, round, triangular, and square.  Naturally,
above the buttons are instructions written in EBCDIC.  A large sign
above all the buttons says in English:

Dam
You can see:  A wrench.
You are at the base of flood control dam #3, which looms above you
and to the north.   The Frigid River is flowing by here.  Across the
river are the white cliffs, which seem to form a giant wall stretching
from north to south along the east shore of the river as it winds its
way downstream.
There is a folded pile of plastic here which has a small valve attached.
A sharp stick, which appears to have been broken at one end, is here.
The boat inflates and appears seaworthy.
Dropped.
>Done.
You are now in the magic boat.
You are on the Frigid River in the vicinity of the dam.  The river
flows quietly here.  There is a landing on the west shore.
You are in the magic boat.
The magic boat contains:
  A tan label.
  A sharp broken stick.
The river turns a corner here making it impossible to see the
dam.  The white cliffs loom on the east bank, and large rocks
prevent landing on the west.
You are in the magic boat.
The magic boat contains:
  A tan label.
  A sharp broken stick.
The river descends here into a valley.  There is a narrow beach on
the east below the cliffs, and there is some shore on the west which
may be suitable.  In the distance a faint rumbling can be heard.
You are in the magic boat.
The magic boat contains:
  A tan label.
  A sharp broken stick.
The river is running faster here, and the sound ahead appears to be
that of rushing water.  On the west shore is a sandy beach.  A small
area of beach can also be seen below the cliffs.
You are in the magic boat.
There is a red buoy here (probably a warning).
The magic boat contains:
  A tan label.
  A sharp broken stick.
Taken.
Something seems funny about the feel of the buoy.
You are on a large sandy beach at the shore of the river, which is
flowing quickly by.  A path runs beside the river to the south here.
You are in the magic boat.
The magic boat contains:
  A tan label.
  A sharp broken stick.
You are on your own feet again.

The hole is getting deeper, but that's about it.
You are surrounded by a wall of sand on all sides.
You can see a small statue in the sand.
>Taken.
Dropped.
Dropped.
You are on the shore of the river.  The river here seems somewhat
treacherous.  A path travels from north to south here, the south end
quickly turning around a sharp corner.
You are at the top of Aragain Falls, an enormous waterfall with a
drop of about 450 feet.  The only path here is on the north end.
There is a man-sized barrel here which you could fit into.
A beautiful rainbow can be seen over the falls and to the east.
Suddenly, the rainbow appears to become solid and, I venture,
walkable (I think the giveaway was the stairs and bannister).
Dropped.
You are on top of a rainbow (I bet you never thought you would walk
on a rainbow), with a magnificent view of the falls.  The rainbow
travels east-west here.
You are on a small beach on the continuation of the Frigid River
past the falls.  The beach is narrow due to the presence of the white
cliffs.  The river canyon opens here, and sunlight shines in from
above.  A rainbow crosses over the falls to the west, and a narrow path
continues to the southeast.
At the end of the rainbow is a pot of gold.
Taken.
You are beneath the walls of the river canyon, which may be climbable
here.  There is a small stream here, which is the lesser part of the
runoff of Aragain Falls.  To the north is a narrow path.
You are on a ledge about halfway up the wall of the river canyon.
You can see from here that the main flow from Aragain Falls twists
along a passage which it is impossible to enter.  Below you is the
canyon bottom.  Above you is more cliff, which still appears
climbable.
>You are at the top of the great canyon on its south wall. From here
there is a marvelous view of the canyon and parts of the Frigid River
upstream.  Across the canyon, the walls of the white cliffs still
appear to loom far above.  Following the canyon upstream (north and
northwest), Aragain Falls may be seen, complete with rainbow.
Fortunately, my vision is better than average, and I can discern the
top of flood control dam #3 far to the distant north.  To the
west and south can be seen an immense forest, stretching for miles
around.  It is possible to climb down into the canyon from here.
You are in a forest, with trees in all directions around you.
You are in a dimly lit forest, with large trees all around.  To the
east, there appears to be sunlight.
You hear in the distance the chirping of a song bird.
You are facing the south side of a white house.  There is no door here,
and all the windows are barred.

A cyclops, who looks prepared to eat horses (much less mere
adventurers), blocks the staircase.  From his state of health
and the bloodstains on the wall, you gather that he is not very
friendly, though he likes people.
The cyclops, hearing the name of his deadly nemesis, flees the room
by knocking down the wall on the north side of the room.

You can see:  A jewel-encrusted egg.
The jewel-encrusted egg contains:
  A clockwork canary.
You hear a scream of anguish as you violate the robber's hideaway.
Using passages unknown to you, he rushes to its defense.
The thief gestures mysteriously, and the treasures in the room
suddenly vanish.
The thief stabs a deep cut in your upper arm.
>The blow lands, making a shallow gash in the thief's arm.
You are forced back and trip over your own feet, falling heavily to
the floor.
>You are still recovering from the last blow, so your attack is
ineffective.
You parry a lightning thrust, and the thief salutes you with a
grim nod.
>The thief is slashed on the arm, blood begins to trickle down.
The thief rams the haft of his blade into your stomach, leaving you
out of breath.
>You are still recovering from the last blow, so your attack is
ineffective.
You dodge as the thief comes in low.
>The haft of your blade knocks out the thief.
>The unconscious thief cannot defend himself:  he dies.
Almost as soon as the thief breathes his last, a cloud of
sinister black smoke envelops him, and when the fog lifts, the
carcass has disappeared.
As the thief dies, the power of his magic decreases, and his
treasures reappear:  A jewel-encrusted egg.
>I can't see one here.

Taken.
You are in the west end of a large temple.  On the south wall is an
ancient inscription, probably a prayer in a long-forgotten language.
The north wall is solid granite.  The entrance at the west end of the
room is through huge marble pillars.
There is a tour guidebook here.
Taken.
This is a large room, whose north wall is solid granite.  A number
of discarded bags, which crumble at your touch, are scattered about
on the floor.  There is an exit down and what appears to be a newly
created passage to the east.
You are in a small square room, in the middle of which is a recently
created hole through which you can barely discern the floor some ten
feet below.  It doesn't seem likely you could climb back up.  There
are exits to the west and south.
There is a piece of paper on the ground here.
Taken.
The paper is rather worn;  although the writing is barely legible
(the author probably had only a used pencil), it is a very elegant
copperplate.

To Whom It May Concern:

   I regret to report that the rumours regarding treasure contained
in the chamber to which this passage leads have no basis in fact.
Should you nevertheless be sufficiently foolhardy to enter, it will
be quite impossible for you to exit.

				Sincerely yours,
				The Thief
Dropped.
You are in a small square room bounded to the north and west with
marble walls and to the east and south with sandstone walls.
It appears the thief was correct.

The canary chirps, slightly off key, an aria from a forgotten opera.
From out of the greenery flies a lovely song bird.  It perches on a
limb just over your head and opens its beak to sing.  As it does so,
a beautiful brass bauble drops from its mouth, bounces off the top
of your head, and lands glimmering in the grass.  As the canary winds
down, the song bird flies away.

You have entered the land of the living dead, a large desolate
room.  Although it is apparently uninhabited, you can hear the
sounds of thousands of lost souls weeping and moaning.  In
the east corner are stacked the remains of dozens of previous
adventurers who were less fortunate than yourself.  To the east
is an ornate passage, apparently recently constructed.
You are in the Tomb of the Unknown Implementer.  A hollow voice
says, "That's not a bug, it's a feature!"
In the north wall of the room is the Crypt of the Implementers.  It
is made of the finest marble and is apparently large enough for four
headless corpses.  The crypt is closed.  Above the entrance is the
cryptic inscription:

		"Feel Free".
There are four heads here, mounted securely on poles.
There is a large pile of empty Coke bottles here, evidently produced
by the implementers during their long struggle to win totally.
There is a gigantic pile of line-printer output here.  Although the
paper once contained useful information, almost nothing can be
distinguished now.
There is a piece of cake with orange icing here.

Suddenly a sinister, wraithlike figure, cloaked and hooded, appears
seeming to float in the air before you.  In a low, almost inaudible
voice he says, "I welcome you to the ranks of the chosen of Zork.  You
have persisted through many trials and tests and have overcome them
all.  One such as yourself is fit to join even the implementers!"
He then raises his oaken staff and, chuckling, drifts away like a
wisp of smoke, his laughter fading in the distance.
The door of the crypt is extremely heavy, but it opens easily.
Though large and esthetically pleasing, the crypt is empty;  the
sarcophagi, bodies, and rich treasures to be expected in a tomb of
this magnificence are missing.  Inscribed on the wall is the motto of
the implementers, "Feel Free".  There is a door leading out of the
crypt to the south.  The door is open.
The crypt is closed.
The lamp is now off.
It is now pitch black.
>Time passes...
Suddenly, as you wait in the dark, you begin to feel somewhat
disoriented.  The feeling passes, but something seems different.
As you regain your composure, the cloaked figure appears before you
and says, "You are now ready to face the ultimate challenge of
Zork.  Should you wish to do this somewhat more quickly in the
future, you will be given a magic phrase which will at any time
transport you by magic to this point.  To select the phrase, say
	INCANT, <word>
and you will be told your own magic phrase to use by saying
	INCANT, <phrase>
Good luck, and choose wisely!"
You are standing at the top of a flight of stairs that lead down to
a passage below.  Dim light, as from torches, can be seen in the
passage.  Behind you the stairs lead into untouched rock.
Time passes...
Time passes...
>You are standing near one end of a long dimly lit hall.  To the
south, stone stairs ascend.  To the north, the corridor is illum-
inated by torches set high in the wall, out of reach.  On one wall
is a red button.
You are in a small room, with narrow passages exiting to the north
and south.  A narrow red beam of light crosses the room at the north
end, inches above the floor.

Stone Room
The button becomes depressed.
Small Room
You can see:  A sword.
Taken.
You are in part of the long hallway.  The east and west walls are
dressed stone.  In the center of the hall is a shallow stone channel.
In the center of the room the channel widens into a large hole around
which is engraved a compass rose.
A passage enters from the south.
A large mirror fills the north side of the hallway.
The mirror is mounted on a panel which has been opened outward.
You are inside a rectangular box of wood whose structure is rather
complicated.  Four sides and the roof are filled in, and the floor
is open.
   As you face the side opposite the entrance, two short sides of
carved and polished wood are to your left and right.  The left panel
is mahogany, the right pine.  The wall you face is red on its left
half and black on its right.  On the entrance side, the wall is white
opposite the red part of the wall it faces, and yellow opposite the
black section.  The painted walls are at least twice the length of
the unpainted ones.  The ceiling is painted blue.
   In the floor is a stone channel about six inches wide and a foot
deep.  The channel is oriented in a north-south direction.  In the
exact center of the room the channel widens into a circular
depression perhaps two feet wide.  Incised in the stone around this
area is a compass rose.
   Running from one short wall to the other at about waist height
is a wooden bar, carefully carved and drilled.  This bar is pierced
in two places.  The first hole is in the center of the bar (and thus
in the center of the room).  The second is at the left end of the room
(as you face opposite the entrance).  Through each hole runs a wooden
pole.
   The pole at the left end of the bar is short, extending about a
foot above the bar, and ends in a hand grip.  The pole has been
dropped into a hole carved in the stone floor.
   The long pole at the center of the bar extends from the ceiling
through the bar to the circular area in the stone channel.  The
bottom end of this pole has a T-bar a bit less than two feet long
attached to it.  On the T-bar is carved an arrow.  The arrow and
T-bar are pointing west.
The pole is now slightly above the floor.

The pine wall swings open.
As you leave, the door swings shut.
You are in a north-south hallway which ends in a large wooden door.
The south side of the room is divided by a wooden wall into small
hallways to the southeast and southwest.
The wooden door has a barred panel in it at about head height.  The
panel is closed, and the door is closed.
The knock reverberates along the hall.  For a time it seems there
will be no answer.  Then you hear someone unlatching the small wooden
panel.  Through the bars of the great door, the wrinkled face of an
old man appears.  He gazes down at you and intones as follows:
   "I am the master of the dungeon, whose task it is to insure
that none but the most scholarly and masterful adventurers are
admitted into the secret realms of the dungeon.  To ascertain whether
you meet the stringent requirements laid down by the Great
Implementers, I will ask three questions which should be easy for
one of your reputed excellence to answer.  You have undoubtedly
discovered the answers during your travels through the dungeon.
Should you answer each of these questions correctly within five
attempts, then I am obliged to acknowledge your skill and daring and
admit you to these regions.
   "All answers should be in the form 'ANSWER, <answer>'."
The booming voice asks:
"What object is of use in determining the function of the iced cakes?"
>The dungeon master says, "Excellent."
The booming voice asks:
"What object in the dungeon is haunted?"
>The dungeon master says, "Excellent."
The booming voice asks:
"Beside the Temple, to which room is it possible to go from the Altar?"
>The dungeon master says, "Excellent."
The dungeon master, obviously pleased, says, "You are indeed a
master of lore.  I am proud to be at your service."  The massive
wooden door swings open, and the master motions for you to enter.
>You are in a narrow north-south corridor.  At the south end is a door
and at the north end is an east-west corridor.  The door is open.
The dungeon master is quietly leaning on his staff here.
The dungeon master says, "I will follow."
You are in an east-west corridor which turns north at its eastern
and western ends.  The walls of the corridor are marble.  An
additional passage leads south at the center of the corridor.
The dungeon master follows you.
You are in a corridor with polished marble walls.  The corridor
widens into larger areas as it turns west at its northern and
southern ends.
The dungeon master follows you.
You are in a large east-west corridor which opens out to a northern
parapet at its center.  You can see flames and smoke as you peer
towards the parapet.  The corridor turns south at its east and west
ends, and due south is a massive wooden door.  In the door is a small
window barred with iron.  The door is closed.
The dungeon master follows you.
You are standing behind a stone retaining wall which rims a large
parapet overlooking a fiery pit.  It is difficult to see through the
smoke and flame which fills the pit, but it seems to be more or less
bottomless.  It also extends upwards out of sight.  The pit itself
is of roughly dressed stone and is circular in shape.  It is about
two hundred feet in diameter.  The flames generate considerable heat,
so it is rather uncomfortable standing here.
   There is an object here which looks like a sundial.  On it are
an indicator arrow and (in the center) a large button.  On the face
of the dial are numbers "one" through "eight".  The indicator points
to the number "one".
The dungeon master follows you.
The dungeon master says, "I will stay."
The dial now points to "four".
The button depresses with a slight click and pops back.
North Corridor
>The wooden door opens.
You are in a featureless prison cell.  You can see the east-west
corridor outside the open wooden door in front of you.
Behind you is a bronze door which seems to be closed.
The button depresses with a slight click and pops back.
The cell door is now closed.
The bronze door opens.
On the other side of the door is a narrow passage which opens out
into a larger area.
You are in a room of large size, richly appointed and decorated
in a style that bespeaks exquisite taste.  To judge from its
contents, it is the ultimate storehouse of the treasures of Zork.
   There are chests here containing precious jewels, mountains of
zorkmids, rare paintings, ancient statuary, and beguiling curios.
   In one corner of the room is a bookcase boasting such volumes
as "The History of the Great Underground Empire", "The Lives of
the Twelve Flatheads", "The Wisdom of the Implementers", and
other informative and inspiring works.
   On one wall is a completely annotated map of the Dungeon of
Zork, showing points of interest and various troves of treasure,
and indicating the locations of several superior scenic views.
   On the desk at the far end of the room may be found stock
certificates representing a controlling interest in FrobozzCo
International, the multinational conglomerate and parent company
of the Frobozz Magic Boat Co., etc.
   As you gleefully examine your new-found riches, the dungeon
master himself materializes beside you and says, "Now that you have
solved all the mysteries of the dungeon, it is time for you to assume
your rightfully-earned place in the scheme of things.  Long have I
waited for one capable of releasing me from my burden!"  He taps you
lightly on the head with his staff and mumbles a few well-chosen spells.
You feel yourself changing, growing older and more stooped.  For a
moment there are two identical mages staring at each other among the
treasures, then you watch as your counterpart dissolves into a mist
and disappears, a sardonic grin on his face.
Your score in the endgame is 100 [total of 100 points], in 781 moves.
This gives you the rank of Dungeon Master.
The game is over.
