# This document holds some useful, scripted moves. These are designed for     #
# seasoned Zorkers only! They have been fully tested with the PC version of   #
# Dungeon created 11-MAR-91.                                                  #
#                                                                             #
# The syntax for these scripts has been derived from the help menu inside the # 
# game. Commas can be used to string together moves. key words were chosen    #
# based on what the parser `liked' at the time. Carriage returns are used to  #
# initiate specific lines of script. A line must end with a carriage return   #
# for the program to read it! Line length is also important because the       #
# program will determine the length of your command window. These scripts     #
# were made with an 80 character length window in mind.                       #
#                                                                             #
# These scripts can be customized for personal preference and use. Please feel#
# free to edit, change, or add to this document as you see fit! And as always,#
#                                 ENJOY!                                      #

# This script contains MAJOR spoilers and puzzle solutions to the Riddle Room,#
# Tea Room, Pool Room, and Machine Room. The major benefit for this script is #
# the Round Room will not spin randomly. Scripts run after this script will   #
# be able to use the Round Room to get around. Some might argue to do this    #
# script first, which would probably be better. I still think getting the     #
# torch is a major game changer and should be done befor this script.         #

### END OF SCRIPT ###





# This is the full script, end to end. Go ahead, try it, and be a Cheater!    #
# I tested this script out, and it worked 100% of the time for me. There are  #
# a bunch of variables that I have found working with the scripts in this     #
# file. Some of these variables include: the order of the commands, the       #
# number of commands there are up to a certain point, random numbers in the   #
# game that control the thief and the round rooms. So this script might not   #
# work for you. Try it out and see where it fails; see if you can fix it for  #
# you. And have fun!                                                          #
