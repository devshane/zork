		    Welcome to Dungeon!

   Dungeon is a game of adventure, danger, and low cunning.  In it
you will explore some of the most amazing territory ever seen by mortal
man.  Hardened adventurers have run screaming from the terrors contained
within.

   In Dungeon, the intrepid explorer delves into the forgotten secrets
of a lost labyrinth deep in the bowels of the earth, searching for
vast treasures long hidden from prying eyes, treasures guarded by
fearsome monsters and diabolical traps!

   No DECsystem should be without one!

   Dungeon was created at the Programming Technology Division of the MIT
Laboratory for Computer Science by Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, Bruce
Daniels, and Dave Lebling.  It was inspired by the Adventure game of
Crowther and Woods, and the Dungeons and Dragons game of Gygax
and Arneson.  The original version was written in MDL (alias MUDDLE).
The current version was translated from MDL into FORTRAN IV by
a somewhat paranoid DEC engineer who prefers to remain anonymous,
and was later translated to C.

   On-line information may be obtained with the commands HELP and INFO.

You are in the kitchen of the white house.  A table seems to have
been used recently for the preparation of food.  A passage leads to
the west, and a dark staircase can be seen leading upward.  To the
east is a small window which is open.
On the table is an elongated brown sack, smelling of hot peppers.

		 US NEWS & DUNGEON REPORT
11-MAR-91					Late Dungeon Edition

		--- LATE NEWS FLASH!! ---
The endgame is here!  (Somewhere)
There have been some puzzling new discoveries near the Thief's hideaway.

		--- BACKGROUND INFORMATION ---

This version of Dungeon for the PDP-11/VAX-11 has been completely
reimplemented in FORTRAN-IV from the original MDL sources created
at MIT.  The parser in this version is somewhat simpler than the
parser in the ARPAnet version;  within this limit, this version
is fully congruent with the current version on the ARPAnet.

This version has been converted from FORTRAN-IV to C via f77.  If
you have any problems, please report them to:
    ian@airs.com or uunet!airs!ian (Ian Lance Taylor)

>move rug
With a great effort, the rug is moved to one side of the room.
With the rug moved, the dusty cover of a closed trap door appears.
>open trap door

>turn on lamp

The lamp is now on.
>d
You are in a dark and damp cellar with a narrow passageway leading
east, and a crawlway to the south.  To the west is the bottom of a
steep metal ramp which is unclimbable.
The door crashes shut, and you hear someone barring it.
>s
You are on the west edge of a chasm, the bottom of which cannot be
seen.  The east side is sheer rock, providing no exits.  A narrow
passage goes west.  The path you are on continues to the north and south.
>s
You are in an art gallery.  Most of the paintings which were here
have been stolen by vandals with exceptional taste.  The vandals
left through the north, south, or west exits.
Fortunately, there is still one chance for you to be a vandal, for on
the far wall is a work of unparalleled beauty.
>get painting
Taken.
>s
You are in what appears to have been an artist's studio.  The walls
and floors are splattered with paints of 69 different colors.
Strangely enough, nothing of value is hanging here.  At the north and
northwest of the room are open doors (also covered with paint).  An
extremely dark and narrow chimney leads up from a fireplace.  Although
you might be able to get up the chimney, it seems unlikely that you
could get back down.

You are in the large entrance hall of the Bank of Zork, the largest
banking institution of the Great Underground Empire.  A partial
account of its history is in "The Lives of the Twelve Flatheads" with
the chapter on J. Pierpont Flathead.  A more detailed history (albeit
less objective) may be found in Flathead's outrageous autobiography
"I'm Rich and You Aren't - So There!".
Most of the furniture has been ravaged by passing scavengers.  All
that remains are two signs at the northwest and northeast corners of
the room, which say

	<-- WEST VIEWING ROOM		EAST VIEWING ROOM -->
>ne
You are in a small square room, which was used by a bank officer
whose job it was to retrieve safety deposit boxes for the customer.
On the north side of the room is a sign which reads "Viewing Room".
On the east side of the room, above an open door, is a sign reading

		    BANK PERSONNEL ONLY
>e
You are in a large rectangular room.  The east and west walls here
were used for storing safety deposit boxes.  As might be expected,
all have been carefully removed by evil persons.  To the east, west,
and south of the room are large doorways.  The northern "wall"
of the room is a shimmering curtain of light.  In the center of the
room is a large stone cube, about 10 feet on a side.  Engraved on
the side of the cube is some lettering.
>s
This room was the office of the Chairman of the Bank of Zork.
Like the other rooms here, it has been extensively vandalized.
The lone exit is to the north.
A portrait of J. Pierpont Flathead hangs on the wall.

Mr. TAA of Muddle, Mass. says:  "Before I took this course I used
to be a lowly bit twiddler.  Now with what I learned at MIT Tech
I feel really important and can obfuscate and confuse with the best."

Mr. MARC had this to say:  "Ten short days ago all I could look
forward to was a dead-end job as a engineer.  Now I have a promising
future and make really big Zorkmids."

MIT Tech can't promise these fantastic results to everyone, but when
you earn your MDL degree from MIT Tech your future will be brighter.

		   Guide Book To
		Flood Control Dam #3

  Flood control dam #3 (FCD #3) was constructed in year 783 of the
Great Underground Empire to harness the destructive power of the
Frigid River.  This work was supported by a grant of 37 million
zorkmids from the central bureaucracy and your own omnipotent local
tyrant Lord Dimwit Flathead the Excessive.  This impressive structure
is composed of 3.7 cubic feet of concrete, is 256 feet tall at the
center, and 193 feet wide at the top.  The reservoir created behind
the dam has a volume of 37 billion cubic feet, an area of 12 million
square feet, and a shore line of 36 thousand feet.

  The construction of FCD #3 took 112 days from ground breaking to
the dedication.  It required a work force of 384 slaves, 34 slave
drivers, 12 engineers, 2 turtle doves, and a partridge in a pear
tree.  The work was managed by a command team composed of 234
bureaucrats, 2347 secretaries (at least two of whom could type),
12,256 paper shufflers, 52,469 rubber stampers, 245,193 red tape
processors, and nearly one million dead trees.

  We will now point out some of the more interesting features of
FCD #3 as we conduct you on a guided tour of the facilities.

You are in what appears to have been the maintenance room for flood
control dam #3, judging by the assortment of tool chests around the

the valuable equipment is gone.  On the wall in front of you is a
panel of buttons, which are labelled in EBCDIC.  However, they are of
different colors:  blue, yellow, brown, and red.  The doors to this

You are outside a large gateway, on which is inscribed:

	"Abandon every hope, all ye who enter here."

The gate is open.  Through it you can see a desolation, with a pile of
mangled corpses in one corner.  Thousands of voices, lamenting some
hideous fate, can be heard.
The way through the gate is barred by evil spirits, who jeer at your
attempts to pass.

You have entered the land of the living dead, a large desolate
room.  Although it is apparently uninhabited, you can hear the
sounds of thousands of lost souls weeping and moaning.  In
the east corner are stacked the remains of dozens of previous
adventurers who were less fortunate than yourself.  To the east
is an ornate passage, apparently recently constructed.
>e
You are in the Tomb of the Unknown Implementer.  A hollow voice
says, "That's not a bug, it's a feature!"
In the north wall of the room is the Crypt of the Implementers.  It
is made of the finest marble and is apparently large enough for four
headless corpses.  The crypt is closed.  Above the entrance is the
cryptic inscription:

		"Feel Free".
There are four heads here, mounted securely on poles.
There is a large pile of empty Coke bottles here, evidently produced
by the implementers during their long struggle to win totally.
There is a gigantic pile of line-printer output here.  Although the
paper once contained useful information, almost nothing can be
distinguished now.

You are in a small square room, in the middle of which is a recently
created hole through which you can barely discern the floor some ten
feet below.  It doesn't seem likely you could climb back up.  There
are exits to the west and south.
There is an elvish sword here.
There is a piece of paper on the ground here.
>read paper
Taken.
The paper is rather worn;  although the writing is barely legible
(the author probably had only a used pencil), it is a very elegant
copperplate.

To Whom It May Concern:

   I regret to report that the rumours regarding treasure contained
in the chamber to which this passage leads have no basis in fact.
Should you nevertheless be sufficiently foolhardy to enter, it will
be quite impossible for you to exit.

				Sincerely yours,
				The Thief

You are in a small square room bounded to the north and west with
marble walls and to the east and south with sandstone walls.
It appears the thief was correct.

The architecture of this region is getting complex, so that further
descriptions will be diagrams of the immediate vicinity in a 3x3
grid.  The walls here are rock, but of two different types - sandstone
and marble.  The following notations will be used:
			..  = current position (middle of grid)
			MM  = marble wall
			SS  = sandstone wall
			??  = unknown (blocked by walls).

The canary chirps, slightly off key, an aria from a forgotten opera.
From out of the greenery flies a lovely song bird.  It perches on a
limb just over your head and opens its beak to sing.  As it does so,
a beautiful brass bauble drops from its mouth, bounces off the top
of your head, and lands glimmering in the grass.  As the canary winds
down, the song bird flies away.

label translates to 'START'.  The switch does not appear to be manip-
ulable by any human hand (unless the fingers are about 1/16 by 1/4

Suddenly a sinister, wraithlike figure, cloaked and hooded, appears
seeming to float in the air before you.  In a low, almost inaudible
voice he says, "I welcome you to the ranks of the chosen of Zork.  You
have persisted through many trials and tests and have overcome them
all.  One such as yourself is fit to join even the implementers!"
He then raises his oaken staff and, chuckling, drifts away like a
wisp of smoke, his laughter fading in the distance.
>open crypt
The door of the crypt is extremely heavy, but it opens easily.
>n
Though large and esthetically pleasing, the crypt is empty;  the
sarcophagi, bodies, and rich treasures to be expected in a tomb of
this magnificence are missing.  Inscribed on the wall is the motto of
the implementers, "Feel Free".  There is a door leading out of the
crypt to the south.  The door is open.
>close crypt
The crypt is closed.
>turn off
You must supply a direct object.
>turn off lamp
The lamp is now off.
It is now pitch black.
>wait
Time passes...
Suddenly, as you wait in the dark, you begin to feel somewhat
disoriented.  The feeling passes, but something seems different.
As you regain your composure, the cloaked figure appears before you
and says, "You are now ready to face the ultimate challenge of
Zork.  Should you wish to do this somewhat more quickly in the
future, you will be given a magic phrase which will at any time
transport you by magic to this point.  To select the phrase, say
	INCANT, <word>
and you will be told your own magic phrase to use by saying
	INCANT, <phrase>
Good luck, and choose wisely!"
You are standing at the top of a flight of stairs that lead down to
a passage below.  Dim light, as from torches, can be seen in the
passage.  Behind you the stairs lead into untouched rock.
>incant link
I don't understand that.
>incant, link
A hollow voice replies:  "LINK   BFLWNJ".
>d
You are standing near one end of a long dimly lit hall.  To the
south, stone stairs ascend.  To the north, the corridor is illum-
inated by torches set high in the wall, out of reach.  On one wall
is a red button.
>n
You are in a small room, with narrow passages exiting to the north
and south.  A narrow red beam of light crosses the room at the north
end, inches above the floor.

Small Room
You can see:  A sword.
>get sword

>n
You are in part of the long hallway.  The east and west walls are
dressed stone.  In the center of the hall is a shallow stone channel.
In the center of the room the channel widens into a large hole around
which is engraved a compass rose.
A passage enters from the south.
A large mirror fills the north side of the hallway.
The mirror is mounted on a panel which has been opened outward.
>enter
You are inside a rectangular box of wood whose structure is rather
complicated.  Four sides and the roof are filled in, and the floor
is open.
   As you face the side opposite the entrance, two short sides of
carved and polished wood are to your left and right.  The left panel
is mahogany, the right pine.  The wall you face is red on its left
half and black on its right.  On the entrance side, the wall is white
opposite the red part of the wall it faces, and yellow opposite the
black section.  The painted walls are at least twice the length of
the unpainted ones.  The ceiling is painted blue.
   In the floor is a stone channel about six inches wide and a foot
deep.  The channel is oriented in a north-south direction.  In the
exact center of the room the channel widens into a circular
depression perhaps two feet wide.  Incised in the stone around this
area is a compass rose.
   Running from one short wall to the other at about waist height
is a wooden bar, carefully carved and drilled.  This bar is pierced
in two places.  The first hole is in the center of the bar (and thus
in the center of the room).  The second is at the left end of the room
(as you face opposite the entrance).  Through each hole runs a wooden
pole.
   The pole at the left end of the bar is short, extending about a
foot above the bar, and ends in a hand grip.  The pole has been
dropped into a hole carved in the stone floor.
   The long pole at the center of the bar extends from the ceiling
through the bar to the circular area in the stone channel.  The
bottom end of this pole has a T-bar a bit less than two feet long
attached to it.  On the T-bar is carved an arrow.  The arrow and
T-bar are pointing west.

>push pine panel

>n
As you leave, the door swings shut.
You are in a north-south hallway which ends in a large wooden door.
The south side of the room is divided by a wooden wall into small
hallways to the southeast and southwest.
The wooden door has a barred panel in it at about head height.  The
panel is closed, and the door is closed.
>knock on door
The knock reverberates along the hall.  For a time it seems there
will be no answer.  Then you hear someone unlatching the small wooden
panel.  Through the bars of the great door, the wrinkled face of an
old man appears.  He gazes down at you and intones as follows:
   "I am the master of the dungeon, whose task it is to insure
that none but the most scholarly and masterful adventurers are
admitted into the secret realms of the dungeon.  To ascertain whether
you meet the stringent requirements laid down by the Great
Implementers, I will ask three questions which should be easy for
one of your reputed excellence to answer.  You have undoubtedly
discovered the answers during your travels through the dungeon.
Should you answer each of these questions correctly within five
attempts, then I am obliged to acknowledge your skill and daring and
admit you to these regions.
   "All answers should be in the form 'ANSWER, <answer>'."
The booming voice asks:
"What is the absolute minimum specified value of the Zorkmid
treasures, in Zorkmids?"
>answer, 30003
The dungeon master says, "Excellent."
The booming voice asks:
"The taking of which object offends the ghosts?"
>answer, skeleton
The dungeon master says, "Excellent."
The booming voice asks:
"From which room can one enter the robber's hideaway without passing
through the cyclops room?"
>answer, temple
The dungeon master says, "Excellent."
The dungeon master, obviously pleased, says, "You are indeed a
master of lore.  I am proud to be at your service."  The massive
wooden door swings open, and the master motions for you to enter.
>n
You are in a narrow north-south corridor.  At the south end is a door
and at the north end is an east-west corridor.  The door is open.
The dungeon master is quietly leaning on his staff here.
>get master
"I'm willing to accompany you, but not to ride in your pocket!"
>n
You are in an east-west corridor which turns north at its eastern
and western ends.  The walls of the corridor are marble.  An
additional passage leads south at the center of the corridor.
The dungeon master follows you.
>e
You are in a corridor with polished marble walls.  The corridor
widens into larger areas as it turns west at its northern and
southern ends.
The dungeon master follows you.
>n
You are in a large east-west corridor which opens out to a northern
parapet at its center.  You can see flames and smoke as you peer
towards the parapet.  The corridor turns south at its east and west
ends, and due south is a massive wooden door.  In the door is a small
window barred with iron.  The door is closed.
The dungeon master follows you.
>n
You are standing behind a stone retaining wall which rims a large
parapet overlooking a fiery pit.  It is difficult to see through the
smoke and flame which fills the pit, but it seems to be more or less
bottomless.  It also extends upwards out of sight.  The pit itself
is of roughly dressed stone and is circular in shape.  It is about
two hundred feet in diameter.  The flames generate considerable heat,
so it is rather uncomfortable standing here.
   There is an object here which looks like a sundial.  On it are
an indicator arrow and (in the center) a large button.  On the face
of the dial are numbers "one" through "eight".  The indicator points
to the number "one".
The dungeon master follows you.
>turn dial to 4
The dial now points to "four".
>push button
The button depresses with a slight click and pops back.
>tell master, stay
The dungeon master says, "I will stay."
>s
North Corridor
>s
The cell door is closed.
>open door
The wooden door opens.
>s
You are in a featureless prison cell.  You can see the east-west
corridor outside the open wooden door in front of you.
Behind you is a bronze door which seems to be closed.
>tell master, push button
The button depresses with a slight click and pops back.
The cell door is now closed.
>open bronze door
The bronze door opens.
On the other side of the door is a narrow passage which opens out
into a larger area.
>s
You are in a room of large size, richly appointed and decorated
in a style that bespeaks exquisite taste.  To judge from its
contents, it is the ultimate storehouse of the treasures of Zork.
   There are chests here containing precious jewels, mountains of
zorkmids, rare paintings, ancient statuary, and beguiling curios.
   In one corner of the room is a bookcase boasting such volumes
as "The History of the Great Underground Empire", "The Lives of
the Twelve Flatheads", "The Wisdom of the Implementers", and
other informative and inspiring works.
   On one wall is a completely annotated map of the Dungeon of
Zork, showing points of interest and various troves of treasure,
and indicating the locations of several superior scenic views.
   On the desk at the far end of the room may be found stock
certificates representing a controlling interest in FrobozzCo
International, the multinational conglomerate and parent company
of the Frobozz Magic Boat Co., etc.
   As you gleefully examine your new-found riches, the dungeon
master himself materializes beside you and says, "Now that you have
solved all the mysteries of the dungeon, it is time for you to assume
your rightfully-earned place in the scheme of things.  Long have I
waited for one capable of releasing me from my burden!"  He taps you
lightly on the head with his staff and mumbles a few well-chosen spells.
You feel yourself changing, growing older and more stooped.  For a
moment there are two identical mages staring at each other among the
treasures, then you watch as your counterpart dissolves into a mist
and disappears, a sardonic grin on his face.
Your score in the endgame is 100 [total of 100 points], in 786 moves.
This gives you the rank of Dungeon Master.
The game is over.
